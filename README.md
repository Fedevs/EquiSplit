# Overview

We've all been there â€“ that moment when a group of friends or roommates gathers, shares a meal, and then the question arises: "How do we split the bill?" Tired of the hassle of manual calculations and keeping track of who owes what to whom, we decided to simplify the process. Introducing EquiSplit, an app designed to streamline the management of shared expenses among friends or teammates.

# Usage

In the second step, you need to add participants along with their contributions, and the app will handle all the calculations.

## Custom Share
When adding participants and their contributions, you can specify the percentage of participation for each person. This allows for a more flexible calculation, ensuring that expenses are distributed according to each individual's share. For example, if one person contributes $600 and another contributes $400, and the first person has a 60% participation, while the second has 40%, the app will accurately calculate the amounts owed, considering the custom percentage distribution (0 in this example).


# PageSpeed Insights

It is important for a website to load quickly, have good SEO, and prioritize accessibility for the following reasons:

**User Experience:** Fast-loading websites provide a better user experience. Users expect quick access to content, and a slow website can lead to frustration and high bounce rates.

**Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Good SEO practices help a website rank higher in search engine results. This means more visibility and organic traffic, which can be crucial for the success of an online presence.

**Accessibility:** Prioritizing accessibility ensures that the website is usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. It promotes inclusivity and compliance with legal requirements, enhancing the website's reach and reputation.

That's why I decided to use Google's tool called [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about) to ensure that the application complies with the standards of the top search engine today.
