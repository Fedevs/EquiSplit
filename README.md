# Overview

We've all been there â€“ that moment when a group of friends or roommates gathers, shares a meal, and then the question arises: "How do we split the bill?" Tired of the hassle of manual calculations and keeping track of who owes what to whom, we decided to simplify the process. Introducing EquiSplit, an app designed to streamline the management of shared expenses among friends or teammates.

# Usage

In the second step, you need to add participants along with their contributions, and the app will handle all the calculations.

## Custom Share
When adding participants and their contributions, you can specify the percentage of participation for each person. This allows for a more flexible calculation, ensuring that expenses are distributed according to each individual's share. For example, if one person contributes $600 and another contributes $400, and the first person has a 60% participation, while the second has 40%, the app will accurately calculate the amounts owed, considering the custom percentage distribution (0 in this example).

## Translation
The app is going to be available in Spanish soon

## Dark theme
For those who loves a dark background
